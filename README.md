Project Name: Traffic Flow Prediction using Deep Learning Models

This project focuses on developing an effective traffic flow prediction system using deep learning models and large amounts of traffic data. The study compares the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model, Stacked Auto Encoder (SAE), and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. Experimental results demonstrate that the GRU model is more applicable and performs better than other deep learning and shallow machine learning prediction networks. The project applies the Adam optimizer with adaptive learning rates to optimize the LSTM model and evaluates the performance of these models on the Caltrans Performance Management System (PeMS) dataset. It is found that GRU models outperform both LSTM models and other approaches like ARIMA and SAEs, exhibiting better performance and faster convergence.
